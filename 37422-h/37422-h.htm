<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>According to "Some Account of the Life of Mr. W. Mountfort"
prefixed to the collected plays of 1720, William Mountfort,
successful playwright and actor, was born "the Son of
Captain <i>Mountfort</i>, a Gentleman of a good Family in <i>Staffordshire</i>;
and he spent the greatest Part of his Younger Years in
that County, without being bred up to any Employment." Since
"his Gaiety of Temper and Airy Disposition ... could not be
easily restrain'd to the solitary Amusements of a Rural Life,"<a name="FNanchor_1_1"id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1"class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
he set out to make his fortune in London, and was employed by
the Duke's Company at the Dorset Garden Theater. First notice
of him appears in the part of the "boy" in <i>The Counterfeits</i>, attributed
to John Leanerd, and produced in May, 1678.<a name="FNanchor_2_2"id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2"class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Mountfort was to win notice as an actor in the part of
Talboy in Brome's <i>The Jovial Crew</i>, where as a rejected lover
he was called upon for storms of comic tears. In his <i>Apology</i>,
Cibber praises Mountfort in this part: "in his Youth, he had
acted Low Humour, with great Success, even down to <i>Tallboy</i>

in the <i>Jovial Crew</i>"<a name="FNanchor_3_3"id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3"class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and Mountfort himself alluded to his early
success in the prologue to his first play, <i>The Injured Lovers</i>,
where he defies the critics: "True Talboy to the last I'll Cry and
Write."</p>

<p>Mountfort scored his first major success as an actor when
he played the title role in Crowne's <i>Sir Courtly Nice</i>. The
play's popularity owed much to Mountfort's acting of a part
which recalls Etherege's Sir Fopling Flutter. The "Account" of
1720 says that Mountfort "gain'd a great and deserved
Reputation, as a Player; particularly in Acting the part of Sir
<i>Courtly Nice</i>," and Cibber, who was later to create the great Sir
Novelty Fashion, says of Mountfort's Sir Courtly:</p>

<blockquote><p>There his whole Man, Voice, Mien, and Gesture, was
no longer <i>Monfort</i>, but another Person. There, the insipid,
soft Civility, the elegant, and formal Mien; the
drawling delicacy of Voice, the stately Flatness of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[ii]</a></span>

Address, and the empty Eminence of his Attitudes
were ... nicely observ'd.... If, some Years after the
Death of <i>Monfort</i>, I my self had any Success, in either
of these Characters, I must pay the Debt I owe to his
Memory, in confessing the Advantages I receiv'd from
the just Idea, and strong Impression he had given me,
from his action them (<i>Apology</i>, p. 76).</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1686, Mountfort married one of the attractive young actresses
then appearing in London, Susanna Percival, and the
Mountforts appeared together in a number of plays until his
untimely death.</p>

<p>Mountfort brought his first play, <i>The Injured Lovers</i>: or,
<i>The Ambitious Father</i>, a tragedy, to be acted at Drury Lane
early in February, 1688. The play was not a great success.
Gildon mentions that it "did not succeed as the Author
wish'd,"<a name="FNanchor_4_4"id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4"class="fnanchor">[4]</a> although the play was brilliantly cast, with Betterton,
Mrs. Bracegirdle, and Mrs. Barry in chief parts. Mountfort himself
played second lead to Betterton, and the comedians
Leigh, Jevon, and Underhill appeared in boisterous roles. But
this rather extravagant account of passion and thwarted love
did not take. Such lines as the heroine's "Thy <i>Antelina</i>, she
shall be the Pile / On which I'll burn, and as I burn I'll smile,"
reveals an uncertain poetic talent. In the prologue Mountfort
manages more wit:</p>

<blockquote>
JO. <i>Hayne's Fate is now become my Share,<br />
For I'm a Poet, Marry'd, and a Player:<br />
The greatest of these Curses is the First;<br />

As for the latter Two, I know the worst ...</i><br />
</blockquote>

<p>And of the play's fate:</p>

<blockquote>
<i>Damn it who will, Damn me, I'll write again;<br />
Clap down each Thought, nay, more than I can think,<br />

Ruin my Family in Pen and Ink.<br />
And tho' my Heart should burst to see your Spite,<br />
True Talboy to the last, I'll Cry and Write....</i><br />
</blockquote>

<p>Unsuccessful at tragedy, Mountfort moved to surer ground, and
if tragedy did not sell on the market of the 1680's, farce was
surefire. Mountfort's <i>The Life and Death of Doctor Faustus,
Made into a Farce ... with the Humours of Harlequin and
Scaramouche</i>, is a most interesting example of Restoration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[iii]</a></span>

farce. The Queen's Theater in Dorset Garden was well-fitted
for stage spectacle and effect, and Mountfort took advantage of
his knowledge of the stage and the contemporary audience to
produce an amusing and popular hit. The play was revived in
1697, five years after Mountfort's death, and again in 1724, at a
time when, as Borgman tells us (p. 39), <i>The Injured Lovers</i> had
been long forgotten.</p>

<p>Mountfort continued his acting career with great success;
he was one of twenty-two men and six women who, on 12
January 1688, were given the position of "Comoedians in Ordinary"
to King James, and he acted in a variety of plays, including
Shadwell's <i>The Squire of Alsatia</i>, in May, 1688, and
<i>Bury Fair</i>, in April, 1689. In Dryden's <i>Don Sebastian</i>, produced
in December, 1689, he played the young and noble Don Antonio,
described as "the wittiest Woman's toy in Portugal."
Although Mountfort was best known for comic roles, he
scored a success as Alexander in Nathaniel Lee's <i>The Rival
Queens</i>, January, 1690. Cibber says of his Alexander:</p>

<blockquote><p>In Tragedy he was the most affecting Lover within my
Memory. His Addresses had a resistless Recommendation
from the very Tone of his Voice ... All this he
particularly verify'd in that Scene of <i>Alexander</i>,
where the Heroe throws himself at the Feet of <i>Statira</i>
for Pardon of his past Infidelities. There we saw the
Great, the Tender, the Penitent, the Despairing, the
Transported, and the Amiable, in the highest Perfection
(<i>Apology</i>, pp. 74-75).</p></blockquote>

<p>Mountfort's third play was acted in January, 1690, although
it may have been produced as early as December of the
previous year. <i>The Successful Strangers</i>, a tragi-comedy, was
based on a novel by Scarron, <i>The Rival Brothers</i>. In his
Preface, Mountfort confesses, "<i>I am no Scholar, which renders
me incapable of stealing from Greek and Latin Authors, as the
better Learned have done</i>". The play was a success; its combination
of comedy and tragedy appealed to the town, and it
was revived several times in the early eighteenth century.</p>

<p>As Borgman notes (p. 80), Mountfort's acting career
peaked in the season of 1690-1691, when he acted nine new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
roles, eight of which were leads. He also prepared a comedy of
his own, <i>Greenwich Park</i>, and assisted in the writing or
preparation of three other plays. He assisted Settle with
<i>Distress'd Innocence</i>, and his name is linked with two plays by
John Bancroft, <i>Edward III</i> and <i>Henry the Second</i>, although his
contribution here, if any, is uncertain. The publishers of the
collected plays of 1720 note that "we have annex'd, <i>King Edward
the Third</i>, and <i>Henry the Second</i>; which tho' not wholly
composed by him, it is presum'd he had, at least, a Share in fitting
them for the Stage, otherwise it cannot be supposed he
would have taken the Liberty of Writing Dedications to them."
Borgman says of these plays that Mountfort "doubtless scanned
the script with a critical eye and made such changes as would
seem necessary to an experienced man of the theater" (p. 90).</p>

<p>In <i>Greenwich Park</i>, Mountfort scored his greatest success.
The comedy is a hilarious mixture of the comedy of manners,
humours, and farce. The prologue sounds the dominant motif
of the play, that of satiric and energetic sex-intrigue: "At
Greenwich lies the Scene, where many a Lass / Has bin Green-gown'd
upon the tender Grass." The play hits wittily at fortune-hunters,
cits, and old fellows who attempt to ignore their age.
There is heavy reference to the contemporary London scene.
The comedy was produced in April, 1691, with great success;
Gildon says of it: "a very pretty Comedy, and has been always
received with general Applause" (<i>Lives and Characters</i>, p.
102). The gay and witty Florella was played by Mrs. Mountfort&mdash;who
played a part very much like that in which she was
so successful previously, Sir Anthony Love. Mrs. Barry played
the passionate Dorinda, a promiscuous and mercenary woman
who, at one point in the play, cries out in the best tradition of
sentimental comedy: "Oh what a Curse 'tis, when for filthy
Gain / We affect a Pleasure in a real Pain." Sir Thomas
Reveller, the heavy but comic father, was played by Leigh;
Nokes and Underhill played comic cits, and Mountfort himself
played opposite his wife as Young Reveller. The play was
revived repeatedly, and remains a delightful work.</p>

<p>Mountfort's best part of his last year came in December,
1691, when he played the hilarious lout, Mr. Friendall, of
Southerne's <i>The Wives' Excuse</i>. The play is good comedy, but
quite serious, as Southerne focuses on the distress of an intelligent,
sensitive woman, saddled with a foolish husband who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
is the perfect representative of a frivolous and malicious
society. On Friday, 2 December 1692, Mountford acted what
must have been his final role, Alexander in <i>The Rival Queens</i>.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Mountfort's life ended at the height of his fame, in the
most spectacular and dramatic murder of its time. The
notorious Lord Mohun, then age fifteen, frequented the
playhouse in 1692, often in the company of Captain Richard
Hill, age twenty. Hill hoped to win the affections of Anne
Bracegirdle, known not only for her beauty and acting ability,
but also for her chastity&mdash;supposedly a scarce virtue among the
actresses of the time. In <i>A Comparison between the Two
Stages</i>, the following dialogue takes place:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Sullen</i>: But does that <i>Romantick Virgin</i> [Bracegirdle] still
keep up her great Reputation?</p>

<p><i>Critick</i>: D'ye mean her Reputation for Acting?</p>

<p><i>Sullen</i>: I mean her Reputation for not acting; you understand
me&mdash;....<a name="FNanchor_5_5"id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5"class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Hill, making no headway with Mrs. Bracegirdle, concluded
that she was in fact interested in Mountfort; they had often appeared
on the stage together. More than once Hill was heard to
utter threats against the actor, although Mohun was apparently
on friendly terms with Mountfort Hill, determined to abduct
the actress, persuaded Mohun to be his accomplice. They set
Friday, 9 December 1692, as the date, and about ten o'clock in
the evening, accompanied by some soldiers under Hill's command,
they ambushed Mrs. Bracegirdle, her mother and her
brother, Hamlet Bracegirdle, along with a man named Page, in
Drury Lane. The actress's mother and Mr. Page fended the
villains off for a time, in a moment a crowd gathered, and the
would-be kidnappers saw that their plan was useless. Hill
escorted the actress home and after having muttered a threat at
Mr. Page proceeded to pace up and down outside their door.
Approximately an hour and a half later, Mountfort appeared in
Howard Street&mdash;apparently intent on confronting Hill and
Mohun. Mohun greeted the actor courteously and asked if he
had been sent for. Mountfort professed that he did not know
anything of the business at hand, that he had come there by
chance, adding that Mrs. Bracegirdle was no concern of his.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
What happened then happened fast and the witnesses disagree
(see Borgman, pp. 135ff). It would seem, however, that Hill
first struck the actor, then quickly drew and ran him through
before Mountfort could draw. On his deathbed, traditionally
the locale for truth-telling, Mountfort reported that "<i>My Lord
Mohun offered me no Violence, but whilst I was talking with
my Lord Mohun, Hill struck me with his Left Hand, and with
his Right Hand run me through, before I could put my Hand to
my Sword</i>" (Borgman, p. 140). It would seem clear that Hill
gave the actor his deathblow and then, while the cry of murder
was raised, escaped into the night. Mountfort, fatally wounded,
staggered toward his own home in the next street. As Mrs.
Mountfort opened the door, her husband fell bleeding into her
arms; at one o'clock in the afternoon of the next day, he died.
According to the "Account," he was to have played Bussy
D'Ambois that night&mdash;Marlowe's tragedy of a young man who
meets his death through assassination.</p>

<p>Although Hill made good his escape, Lord Mohun stood
trial in Westminster before his peers. Mohun's defense was
simply that he was not privy to Hill's design and did not assist
and encourage him in it. The lords, having heard the evidence,
retired, and the next day, Saturday, 5 February, acquitted
Mohun of wrongdoing by a vote of 69-14. The prisoner was
discharged.</p>

<p>The United Company found themselves seriously hampered
by the death of Mountfort, and even more so when fifteen
days later the great comedian Anthony Leigh died. The
"Account" says that Mountfort's death "had so great an Affect
on his Dear Companion, Mr. LEE the Comedian, that he did not
survive him above the space of a Week." The Company delayed
the opening of a new play by one William Congreve, <i>The Old
Bachelor</i>. But when that smash hit finally came on the boards
in March 1693, Susanna Mountfort played the gay évaporée,
Belinda, to great applause. And on 31 January 1694, she
married the actor John Verbruggen. The rather mysterious
Anne Bracegirdle, for whom Mountfort had been killed, played
female leads in all of Congreve's plays, and just as the public
had once speculated on her relationship to Mountfort, they now
speculated on her relationship to Congreve.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<p>Although farce was popular with London audiences during
the Restoration, there was considerable controversy as to what
it was and what it was worth. In a period in which the canon of
English literary criticism was being formed, farce illustrates
the disparity between received classical principles and the
playwright's actual craft. Dryden, who himself "stooped" to
writing farce, nonetheless sneers in his preface to <i>An
Evening's Love, or The Mock-Astrologer</i> [1671]:</p>

<blockquote><p>Farce ... consists principally of grimaces ... Comedy
consists, though of low persons, yet of natural actions
and characters; I mean such humours, adventures, and
designs, as are to be found and met with in the world.
Farce, on the other side, consists of forced humours,
and unnatural events. Comedy presents us with the
imperfections of human nature: Farce entertains us
with what is monstrous and chimerical.<a name="FNanchor_6_6"id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6"class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Farce was theoretically unpopular because it relied on the extravagant
and unnatural, as opposed to the play of real character
found in comedy. And whereas in seventeenth-century
comedy the avowed intention is usually to expose and thus to
reform the vices and follies of the age, farce uses the grossly
physical to draw a laugh; there is nothing to be learned from
the slapstick and pigsbladder.</p>

<p>Though sneered at by theorists and subject to endless
abuse in the prologues and epilogues of the day, farce continued
as pleasing to Restoration audiences as it is today. James
Sutherland notes that shrewd actor-playwrights such as Mountfort,
Betterton, Underhill, Jevon, Dogget, Powell&mdash;men who
knew intimately the tastes of the town, chose to write farce.<a name="FNanchor_7_7"id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7"class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Tate's <i>A Duke and No Duke</i>, Aphra Behn's <i>The Emperor of the
Moon</i>, and Jevon's <i>The Devil of a Wife</i>, were among the most
popular offerings, and although the Restoration wit may have
gone to "Dr. Faustus" with a certain sense of intellectual slumming,
he did continue to support quite generously the <i>farceurs</i>
of that time. Moreover, farcical elements appear regularly in
the supposedly elegant and artificial Restoration comedy of
manners.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dr. Faustus" is a highly competent putting-together of
those components which the experienced actor-playwright
knew to be surefire. The date of its premier production is not
known and has been assigned to a date as early as 1684 and as
late as 1688. The farce was not published until the quarto of
1697, which appeared without cast-list, prologue, or epilogue.<a name="FNanchor_8_8"id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8"class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
The title page, however, states that the farce was acted at Dorset
Garden "several times," by "Lee" (Anthony Leigh) and
Jevon, and, as the editor of <i>The London Stage</i> points out, since
Jevon died in December of 1688, the premiere was probably no
later than the season of 1687-1688.<a name="FNanchor_9_9"id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9"class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Borgman maintains that
"Dr. Faustus" is Mountfort's second work, after <i>The Injured
Lovers</i> of February, 1688, noting that the epilogue to that play,
spoken by Jevon, suggests that Mountfort was planning, or had
written, a farce:</p>

<blockquote><i>
Pardon but this, and I will pawn my life,<br />
His next shall match my Devil of a Wife,<br />
We'll grace it with the Imbellishment of Song and Dance;<br />
We'll have the Monsieur once again from <i>France</i>,<br />
With's Hoop and Glasses, and when that is done,<br />
He shall divert you with his Riggadoon.<br />
</i></blockquote>

<p>We might guess, then, that if the epilogue does refer to "Dr.
Faustus," the date of that play is as late as the Spring of 1688.</p>

<p>Mountfort took as his raw material Marlowe's great
tragedy and for that reason "Dr. Faustus" may be to some extent
thought of as a burlesque. The Restoration audience
delighted in Marlowe's Faustus; the Elizabethan tragedy had
been played in 1662, and there was a performance at the Duke's
Theater in September, 1675. Edward Phillips wrote in his
<i>Theatrum Poetarum</i>, that "of all that [Marlowe] hath written to
the Stage his Dr. <i>Faustus</i> hath made the greatest noise with its
Devils and such like Tragical sport."<a name="FNanchor_10_10"id="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10"class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Here lies the suggestion
that Mountfort was to take up, for as Borgman notes, Marlowe's
tragedy has two distinct lines: the mighty verse which makes
up the tragedy of an heroic overreacher, and a comic line of farcical
<i>lazzi</i>. Mountfort has trimmed away the poetry of Marlowe
and, for the most part, retained the farcical elements of the
earlier play.<a name="FNanchor_11_11"id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11"class="fnanchor">[11]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span></p>

<p>Mountfort keeps the compact with Mephostopholis, the appearance
of good and bad angels, the visit of Lucifer and
Beelzebub, the pageant of the seven deadly sins, the cheating of
the horse-courser, the admonitions of the Old Man, the summoning
of the spirits of Alexander and Darius, the tricking of
Benvolio, the final moments of remorse before Faustus is
dragged down to hell, and finally, the discovery of Faustus's
limbs in his study. Mountfort's purpose, as Borgman notes, was
not to convert an Elizabethan tragedy into a Restoration one,
but to affix additional farcical materials to a work that already
contained scenes of slapstick.</p>

<p>Mountfort's unique contribution to his source was the introduction
of the <i>commedia dell'arte</i> figures which had
become well-known to London theatergoers because of several
visits to London by Italian actors since the Restoration.
Probably, as Borgman notes (p. 36), the first Englishmen to play
Scaramouche and Harlequin were Griffin and Haynes who had
in 1677 appeared with the King's Company in Ravenscroft's
<i>Scaramouch a Philosopher, Harlequin a School-Boy, Bravo,
Merchant, and Magician</i>. When Aphra Behn's <i>The Emperor of
the Moon</i> appeared in March, 1687, Leigh played Scaramouche
and Harlequin was taken by Jevon. It seems probable that in order
that these two actors might have a further opportunity to
appear as these popular characters, a place was found for
Scaramouche and Harlequin in Mountfort's farce.</p>

<p>The text of Mountfort's "Dr. Faustus" reveals that his
farce, like any, must depend to a great extent on its <i>farceurs</i>. In
Jevon and Leigh he had talented players and much of the script
can be regarded merely as an improvisational chart allowing
the two famed comics to maneuver. Jevon, as Leo Hughes
points out, built up a considerable reputation, chiefly in low
comedy roles since his first notice as Osric in a revival of
Hamlet in 1673.<a name="FNanchor_12_12"id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12"class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Having a slight, thin figure, he was noted for
his grace of movement and agility on the stage; he played
Harlequin. Although Jevon could play such straight roles as
Young Bellair in <i>The Man of Mode</i>, he, along with Nokes, Underhill,
and Leigh, made his reputation in the boisterous farce
of which "Dr. Faustus" is an excellent example.</p>

<p>Anthony Leigh played Scaramouche. Of his acting Cibber
says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>In Humour, he lov'd to take a full Career, but was
careful enough to stop short, when just upon the
Precipice: He had great Variety, in his manner, and
was famous in very different Characters.... But no
wonder <i>Leigh</i> arriv'd to such Fame, in what was so
completely written for him; when Characters that
would make the Reader yawn, in the Closet, have by
the Strength of his Action, been lifted into the lowdest
Laughter, on the Stage (<i>Apology</i>, p. 85-86).</p></blockquote>

<p>That Jevon and Leigh played well together is evident, and one
can see great possibilities in their improvisation of such <i>lazzi</i>
as the episode of the "dead body," Act I, Scene i, or in the
elaborate show of compliment which ends the first act.</p>

<p>The presence of Scaramouche and Harlequin in Mountfort's
adaptation suggests the influence of the Italian and
French <i>commedia</i> on the Restoration stage, although, as Leo
Hughes points out, the native tradition of farce is paramount
(pp. 134-141). Hughes notes that although the <i>commedia</i> influence
is obvious, Italian farce is different in style from the
English, and that although there were four or five tours by
<i>commedia</i> troops between 1660 and 1700, these visits were not
enough to influence significantly English farce writing. Furthermore,
the Italian's art was improvisational&mdash;they used no
printed texts, and the English would therefore have even less
chance to copy from the <i>commedia</i>. Readers of "Dr. Faustus"
will find little trace of <i>commedia</i> influence apart from the conventional
names. Hughes acknowledges (p. 141) the greater influence
of the French stage in the Restoration, owing chiefly to
the great popularity of Molière, whose influence on farce,
especially on the afterpiece which became a staple on the
English stage after 1695, was long-lived. His prestige was great;
he appealed to English taste, and such characters as M. Jourdain,
M. Pourceaugnac, and Sganarelle appear repeatedly in
English adaptations.</p>

<p>The action of farce is typically a string of blow-ups, stage
business highly dependent on fast pacing. Characteristically on
the English stage there is a great deal of stage-effect; "Dr.
Faustus," produced at the Dorset Garden Theater where farce
was often produced in order to take advantage of the elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
stage machinery available there, makes use of rising tables, a
giant which divides in two, good and bad angels which rise and
descend, fireworks, a vanishing feast, a view of hell, and even
more. Indeed, the often hilarious stage directions give us good
insight into the capabilities of the Restoration stage. The finale
is typical: "<i>Scene discovers Faustus's Limbs</i>." After the Old
Man piously hopes that this "May ... a fair Example be to all, /
To avoid such Ways which brought poor Faustus's Fall," the
"<i>Scene changes to Hell. Faustus Limbs come together. A
Dance, and Song.</i>"</p>

<p>Farce often verges on satire, and, as he was to demonstrate
in <i>Greenwich Park</i>, Mountfort had an eye for contemporary
foibles. At the end of Act I, Harlequin and Scaramouche engage
in dialogue which suggests similar passages of rough satire in
Wycherley. Asked what practice his master, a doctor, has,
Harlequin replies:</p>

<blockquote><p>Why his Business is to patch up rotten Whores against
the Term for Country Lawyers, and Attorneys Clerks;
and against <i>Christmas</i>, <i>Easter</i> and <i>Whitsun</i> Holidays,
for City Apprentices; and if his Pills [to cure clap] be
destroy'd, 'twill ruin him in one Term.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mountford altered the pageant of the seven sins that he found
in Marlowe, changing it in at least one case to bring it up to
date. He begins by paraphrasing Marlowe:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Faustus</i>: What art thou the Third?</p>

<p><i>Envy</i>: I am <i>Envy</i>; begot by a Chimny-sweeper upon an
Oyster-wench. I cannot read, and wish all Books burnt.</p></blockquote>

<p>But then Mountford departs from his source, adding the
following lines:</p>

<blockquote><p>I always curst the Governement, that I was not prefer'd;
and was a Male-content in Three Kings Reigns (II, i).</p></blockquote>

<p>The three kings are, I suppose, Charles I, Charles II, and James
II, and the satiric jab is against those who perennially oppose
the Establishment. Furthermore, it is easy to imagine that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
role of Faustus, whoever played it, could well have been acted
as a parody of the "tragical" acting style of the day, with its
curious sing-song tone and stylized gestures.</p>

<p>Mountfort's "Dr. Faustus" gives us an often amusing insight
into that much despised, ever-popular bastard-child of the
Restoration stage: farce. If the direct influence of the <i>commedia</i>
is slight, the spirit of improvisational comedy is embodied
in the inspired buffoonery of Leigh and Jevon, reinforced
by stage-effect and spots of contemporary satire. The
play proved a hit and that undoubtedly was the playwright's
sole intention. The farce is workmanlike, and as the "Account"
prefixed to the 1720 collected plays observes, "THE Life and
Death of Doctor <i>FAUSTUS</i> has a great deal of low, but Entertaining
Humour; it sufficiently shews his Talents that way."</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> Where art thou?</p>

<p><i>Meph.</i> Here.      [<i>a Flash of Light.</i></p>

<p><i>Scar. within.</i> Oh, oh, oh.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> What Noise is that? Hast thou any Companions

<p><i>Meph.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> It comes this way?</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Oh, oh, O&mdash;&mdash;.      [<i>Enter</i> Scaramouche.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> What ail'st thou?</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> O' o' o'</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> Speak, Fellow, what's the Matter?</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> O poor <i>Scaramouche</i>!</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> Speak, I conjure thee; or <i>Acherontis Dii Demogorgon</i>.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> O I beseech you Conjure no more, for I am frighted

<p><i>Faust.</i> Frighted at what?</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> I have seen, Oh, oh&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> What?</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> The Devil.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> Art sure it was the Devil?</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> The Devil, or the Devil's Companion: He had a
Head like a Bulls, with Horns on; and two Eyes that glow'd
like the Balls of a dark Lantern: His Hair stood a Tiptoe,
like your new-fashion'd Top-knots; with a Mouth as large
as a King's Beef Eater: His Nails was as sharp as a Welshman's
in Passion; and he look'd as frightful as a Sergeant to
an <i>Alsatian</i>.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> But why art thou afraid of the Devil?</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Why I never said my Prayers in all my Life, but
once; and that was when my damn'd Wife was sick, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
she might dye: My Ears are as deaf to good Council, as
<i>French</i> Dragoons are to Mercy. And my Conscience wants
as much sweeping as a Cook's Chimny. And I have as
many Sins to answer for as a Church-warden, or an Overseer
of the Poor.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> Why, the Devil loves Sinners at his Heart.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Does he so?</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> He hates none, but the Vertuous, and the Godly.
Such as Fast, and go to Church, and give Alms-deeds.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> I never saw a Church in my Life, thank God, (I
mean the Devil;) and for Fasting, it was always my Abomination;
and for Alms, I never gave any Thing in my
Life, but the Itch once to a Pawn-broker. Therefore I hope
he may Love me.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> And he shall Love thee; I'll bring thee acquainted
with him.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Acquainted with the Devil?</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> Ay; <i>Tanto metropontis Acherontis</i>.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Oh, oh, oh.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> Fear nothing <i>Mephostopholis</i>, be visible.</p>

<p>[Scaramouche <i>sinks behind the Doctor, and peeps his Head
out behind the Slip of his Gown.</i> <i>A Devil rises in Thunder
and Lightning.</i></p>

<p>I charge thee to be gon, and change thy Shape; thou art
too ugly to attend on me. I find there's Virtue in my Charm;
Come, rise up, Fool, the Devil's gon.</p>

<p>[<i>The Devil sinks.</i></p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> The Devil go with him.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> Fear nothing, I command the Devil. If thou wilt
leave thy Chimny-sweeping Trade, and live with me, thou
shalt have Meat and Drink in Plenty; and 40 Crowns a Year
shall be thy Wages; I'll make thee Learned in the black Art.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> I am a Student in that already: But let me consider,
Good Meat and Drink, and 40 Crowns a Year. Then I'll
change my black Art for yours.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> There's Earnest, thou art now my Servant; dispose
of thy Brooms and Poles, they'll be useless to thee here;
take this Key, go into my Study, and clean; take all the
Books you find scatter'd about, and range 'em orderly upon
the Shelves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Happy <i>Scaramouche</i>, now may'st thou Swear, Lye,
Steal, Drink and Whore; for thy Master is the Devil's Master,
and thou in time may'st master 'em both.</p>

<p>[<i>Exit</i> Scaram.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Mephostopholis.</p>

<p><i>Meph.</i> Now, <i>Faustus</i>, what wouldst thou have with me?</p>

<p>
<i>Faust.</i> I charge thee wait upon me whilst I live,<br />
And do what-ever <i>Faustus</i> shall command.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Meph.</i> Ay <i>Faustus</i>, so I will, if thou wilt purchase me of
<i>Lucifer</i>.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> What says <i>Lucifer</i>, thy Lord?</p>

<p>
<i>Meph.</i> That I shall Wait on <i>Faustus</i> whilst he Lives,<br />
So thou wilt buy my Service with thy Blood.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> Already <i>Faustus</i> has hazarded that for thee.</p>

<p>
<i>Meph.</i> Ay, but thou must bequeath it solemnly,<br />
And write a Deed of Gift with it;<br />
For that Security craves <i>Lucifer</i>.<br />
If thou deny it, I must back to Hell.<br />
<br />
<i>Bad Ang.</i> But <i>Faustus</i>, if I shall have thy Soul,<br />
I'll be thy Slave, and worship thy Commands,<br />
And give thee more than thou hast Will of.<br />
<br />
<i>Faust.</i> If he wilt spare me Four and twenty Years,<br />
Letting me Live in all Voluptuousness,<br />
To have thee ever to attend on me,<br />
To give me whatsoever I shall ask,<br />
And tell me whatsoever I demand;<br />
On these Conditions I resign it to him.<br />
<br />
<i>Meph.</i> Then, <i>Faustus</i> stab thy Arm couragiously,<br />
And bind thy Soul, that at some certain Day<br />
Great <i>Lucifer</i> may claim it as his own;<br />
And then be thou as Great as <i>Lucifer</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>Faust.</i> Lo, <i>Mephostopholis</i>, for Love of thee, <i>Faustus</i> has cut<br />
His Arm, and with his proper Blood<br />
Assures his Soul to be great <i>Lucifers</i>.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Meph.</i> But, <i>Faustus</i>, write it in manner of a Deed, and Gift.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> Ay, so I do; but, <i>Mephostopholis</i>, my Blood congeals,
and I can write no more.</p>

<p><i>Meph.</i> I'll fetch thee Fire to dissolve it streight.      [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p>

It is unwilling I should write this Bill.<br />

<p><i>Good and Bad Angel descend.</i></p>

<p><i>Good An.</i> Yet, <i>Faustus</i>, think upon thy precious Soul.</p>

<p><i>Bad An.</i> No, <i>Faustus</i>, think of Honour, and of Wealth.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> Of Wealth. Why all the <i>Indies</i>, <i>Ganges</i>, shall be
mine.</p>

<p><i>Good An.</i> No, <i>Faustus</i>, everlasting Tortures shall be thine.</p>

<p>
<i>Bad An.</i> No, <i>Faustus</i>, everlasting Glory shall be thine.<br />
The World shall raise a Statue of thy Name,<br />
And on it write, This, this is he that could command the<br />
World.      [<i>Good Angel ascends, bad Angel descends.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Faust.</i> Command the World; Ay, <i>Faustus</i>, think on that,<br />
Why streams not then my Blood that I may write?<br />
<i>Faustus</i> gives to thee his Soul; Oh! there it stops. Why<br />
shouldst thou not? Is not thy Soul thy own?<br />
</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Mephostopholis <i>with a Chafer of Fire</i>.</p>

<p><i>Meph.</i> See, <i>Faustus</i>, here is Fire, set it on.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> So now the Blood begins to clear again.</p>

<p><i>Meph.</i> What is't I would not do to obtain his Soul?</p>

<p>

But what is this Inscription on my Arm?<br />

My Senses are deceiv'd, here's nothing writ;<br />
O yes, I see it plain, even here is writ<br />
<i>Homo fuge</i>; yet shall not <i>Faustus</i> fly,<br />
I'll call up something to delight his Mind.<br />

<p><i>Faust.</i> Ay, and the Devil do you good on't.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> Here's a hot Whore indeed, I'll have no Wife.</p>

<p><i>Meph.</i> <i>Faustus</i>, thou shalt.      [<i>Waves his Wand, enters.</i></p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> O <i>Mephostopholis</i>! what would I give to gain a Kiss
from off those lovely Lips.</p>

<p><i>Meph.</i> <i>Faustus</i>, thou may'st.      [<i>He kisses her.</i></p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> My Soul is fled; come <i>Hellen</i>, come, give me my Soul

<p><i>Meph.</i> No, <i>Faustus</i> 'tis Glorious as the upper World; but
that we have Night and Day, as you have here: Above
there's no Night.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> Why sighs my <i>Mephostopholis</i>, I think Hell's a meer

<p><i>Meph.</i> Ay, think so still.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> I have left the Door open to save the Devil the labour
of Knocking, if he has a mind to come in: For I

Black Art.</p>

<p><i>Harl.</i> Oh here's Mr. Doctor himself; he's reading some
conjuring Book. <i>Ide fain jecit.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> This must be a conjuring Book by the hard Words.

<p><i>Scar.</i> I have learn'd to raise the Devil, but how the Devil
shall I do to lay him. Ha! what's here, a dead Body?
The Devil assum'd this Body, and when I began to mutter
my Prayers, he was in such haste he left his Carcass behind
him. Ha! it stirs; no, 'twas but my Fancy.</p>

<p><i>Harl.</i> O good Mr. Doctor, conjure up no more Devils and
I'll be gon, or any thing.&mdash;I came only to ask your Black
Artship a Question.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> No, this is not the Devil. Who art thou? Whence
comest thou? What's thy Business, Quick, or <i>Hogon strogon</i>?</p>

<p><i>Harl.</i> Hold, hold, hold, I am poor <i>Harlequin</i>: By the
Learned I am called <i>Zane</i>, by the Vulgar <i>Jack Pudding</i>. I
was late Fool to a Mountebank; and last Night, in the mistaking
the Pipkin, I eat up a Pot of <i>Bolus</i> instead of Hasty
Pudding; and devour'd Three Yards of <i>Diaculum</i> Plaister
instead of Pancake, for which my Master has turn'd me out
of Doors instead of Wages: Therefore, to be reveng'd, I
come to hire a Devil or two of you, Mr. Doctor, of a strong
Constitution, that may swallow up his Turpentine Pills as fast
as he makes 'em, that he may never cure poor Whore more
of a Clap; and then he'll be undone, for they are his chief
Patients.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> What Practice has he?</p>

<p><i>Harl.</i> Why his Business is to patch up rotten Whores against
the Term for Country Lawyers, and Attorneys Clerks;
and against <i>Christmas</i>, <i>Easter</i> and <i>Whitsun</i> Holidays, for City<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Apprentices; and if his Pills be destroy'd, 'twill ruin him
in one Term.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Come in; and for a Crown a Week I'll lett thee
out a Devil, as they do Horses at Livery, shall swallow him
a Peck of Pills a day, though every one were as big as a Pumpkin;
and make nothing of a <i>Bolus</i> for a Breakfast.</p>

<p><i>Bad An.</i> Thou art a Spirit, Heav'n cannot

<p><i>Fau.</i> Who buzzes in my Ear, I am a Spirit; be I a Devil

<p><i>Luc.</i> None can afford thee help; for only I have Interest
in thee, <i>Faustus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Fau.</i> Oh! What art thou, that looks so terrible?</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> I am <i>Lucifer</i>, and this is my Companion Prince in
Hell.</p>

<p><i>Beel.</i> We are come to tell thee thou dost injure us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Thou call'st on Heav'n contrary to thy Promise.</p>

<p><i>Beel.</i> Thou should'st not think on Heav'n.</p>

<p>
<i>Fau.</i> Nor will I henceforth pardon him for this,<br />
And <i>Faustus</i> Vows never to look to Heav'n.<br />
<br />
<i>Beel.</i> So shalt thou shew thy self a faithful Servant,<br />
And we will highly gratify thee for it.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Fau.</i> Those Words delight my Soul.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> <i>Faustus</i>, we are come in Person to shew thee Passtime;
sit down, and thou shalt behold the Seven Deadly
Sins in their own proper Shapes and Likeness.</p>

<p><i>Fau.</i> That Sight will be as pleasant to my Eye, as Paradise
to <i>Adam</i> the first Day of his Creation.</p>

<p><i>Beel.</i> Talk not of Paradise, but mind the Show. Go, <i>Mephostopholis</i>,
and fetch 'em in; and, <i>Faustus</i>, question 'em their
Names.      <i>Enter Pride.</i></p>

<p><i>Fau.</i> What art thou?</p>

<p><i>Prid.</i> I am <i>Pride</i>; I was begot by Disdain and Affectation.
I always took the Wall of my Betters; had ever the first Cut,
or else would not eat: I scorn'd all Advice, never thought
any one handsom but my self; had the best Pue in the Church,
though a Tradesman's Wife; and at last dyed of the Spleen,
for want of a Coach and Six Horses. Why is not thy Room
perfum'd, and spread with Cloth of <i>Tissue</i>? What must you
sit, and I stand? Rise up Brute.</p>

<p><i>Fau.</i> Go, thou art a proud Slut indeed.      [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Covetousness.</p>

<p>Now what art thou the Second.</p>

<p><i>Cov.</i> I am <i>Covetousness</i>; I was begot by a close Fist, and
a griping Heart, in a Usurer's Chest. I never eat, to save
Charges: This Coat has cover'd me for Fourscore Winters:
This Beard has seen as many more. I never slept in my Life,
but always watch'd my Gold.</p>

<p><i>Fau.</i> What wert thou on Earth?</p>

<p><i>Cov.</i> I was first an Exciseman, and cheated the King and
Country; then I was a Baker, and from every Neighbor's
Loaf I stole Two Pound, and swore 'twas shrunk in the
Oven. I was a Vintner, and by bribing of Quest-men had
leave to sell in Pint Bottles for Quarts: At last I was a Horse-courser,
made <i>Smithfield</i> too hot to hold me, and rid Post to
the Devil? Give me some Gold, Father?      [<i>Exit.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Envy.</p>

<p><i>Fau.</i> What art thou the Third?</p>

<p><i>Env.</i> I am <i>Envy</i>; begot by a Chimny-sweeper upon an
Oyster-wench. I cannot read, and wish all Books burnt. I
always curst the Government that I was not prefer'd; and
was a Male-content in Three Kings Reigns. I am Lean with
seeing others Eat; and I wish the Devil would make a
Sponge of thy Heart, to wipe out the Score of my Sins.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Wrath.</p>

<p><i>Fau.</i> Out, Envious Wretch. What art thou the Fourth?</p>

<p><i>Wra.</i> I am <i>Wrath</i>; I had neither Father nor Mother, but
leap'd out of a Lion's Mouth when I was scarce an Hour
old. I always abhor'd the Art of Patience, and curst all
Fisher-men. I beat my Wife for my Pleasure; curst Heav'n
in my Passion, 'cause it gave me no Fortune, and was hang'd
for a Rape on a <i>Scotch</i> Pedlar.      [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Gluttony.</p>

<p><i>Fau.</i> What art thou the Fifth?</p>

<p><i>Glut.</i> I am <i>Gluttony</i>; begot by a Plow-man on a Washer-woman,
who devour'd a <i>Chedder</i> Cheese in two Hours. I
am of a Royal Pedigree: My Grand-father was a Sur-loin of
Beef, and my Mother a Gammon of Bacon: My Sisters were
Sows, which supply'd me with Pork: My Brothers were
Calves, which afforded me Veal: My God-fathers were
<i>Peter</i> Pickled-Herring, and <i>Michael</i> Milk-Porredg: My God-mothers
were <i>Susan</i> Salt-butter, and <i>Margery</i> Sous'd-Hog's-Face.
Now, <i>Faustus</i>, thou hast heard my Pedigree, wilt
thou invite me to Supper?</p>

<p><i>Fau.</i> Not I.</p>

<p><i>Glut.</i> Then the Devil choak thee.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Sloth.</p>

<p><i>Fau.</i> What art thou the Sixth?</p>

<p><i>Slo.</i> Hey ho! I am <i>Sloth</i>; I was begotten at Church by
a sleepy Judg on a Costermonger's Wife, in the middle of a
long Sermon. I am as Lazy as a Fishmonger in the Dog-days,
or a Parson in <i>Lent</i>: I would not speak another Word
for a King's Ransom.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Leachery.</p>

<p><i>Fau.</i> And what are you, Mr. <i>Minks</i>, the Seventh and last?</p>

<p><i>Leach.</i> I am one that love an Inch of Raw Mutton better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
than an Ell of Fry'd Stock-fish, and the first Letter of my
Name begins with <i>Leachery</i>.      [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Fau.</i> This Sight delights my Soul.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> <i>Faustus</i> in Hell are all manner of Delights.</p>

<p><i>Fau.</i> O might I see Hell once, and return safe.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i><i> Faustus</i>, thou shalt; give me thy hand.
Hence let's descend, and we will <i>Faustus</i> show
The mighty Pleasures in the World below.      [<i>Vanishes.</i></p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Some Wine too?</p>

<p><i>Meph.</i> What else.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> What else: Why if Fornication been't against your
Commandments, we would have some live Flesh; a handsom
Wench.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Only for a third Person, and please your Damnation.</p>

<p><i>Meph.</i> You shall have your Desires.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> We desire your Mephostopholiship too, not to let us
stay the Roasting and Boiling of any thing: For we are as
Eager as the Wine in <i>Smithfield</i>, and want no whetting.</p>

<p><i>Meph.</i> You shall.</p>

<p>Scaramouche <i>and</i> Harlequin <i>pull off their Caps</i>.</p>

<p>Now if your mighty Darkness would please to Retire.</p>

<p><i>Meph.</i> Farewell.      [<i>Vanish.</i></p>

<p>Scaramouche <i>steps out of the Circle, and struts about</i>.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Now how do you like my Art?</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> O rare Art! O divine Mr. Doctor <i>Scaramouche</i>! If
the Devil be as good as his Word, I'll owe him a good Turn
as long as I live: But I wish our third Person would come.</p>

<p><i>A Giant rises.</i></p>

<p>Ha! What's here?</p>

<p><i>Gi.</i> I am sent by <i>Pluto</i> to bear you Company.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Is this his third Person? Or is it Three Generations
in One? Come you from <i>Guild-hall</i>, Sir?</p>

<p><i>Gi.</i> No, Mortal, from the <i>Stygian</i> Lake. I am the Giant
which St. <i>George</i> destroy'd; and in the Earth have been decaying
ever since, but now am come to Eat with you.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> To pick up your Crums, Sir: You'r heartily Welcome.</p>

<p>Scaramouche <i>gets upon</i> Harlequin, <i>and salutes him</i>.</p>

<p><i>Gi.</i> I have lain now within the <i>Stygian</i> Lake 2000 Years.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Your Honour is not much shrunk in the Wetting.</p>

<p><i>Gi.</i> But we loose Time, and Dinner cools.</p>

to let the Table down to us, or send us to that, and I'll be his
Servant as long as I live.      [<i>They are hoisted up to the Table.</i></p>

<p><i>Scar. and Har.</i> Oh, oh, oh.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Now have a care of another Proverb:
We go without our Supper.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Nay, now I know the Devil's Humour, I'll hit him
to a Hair: Pray, Mr. Doctor, cut up that Pasty.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> I can't get my Knife into it, 'tis over-bak'd.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Ay, 'tis often so: God sends Meat, and the Devil
sends Cooks.      [<i>Table flies down.</i></p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Thou Varlet, dost thou see what thy Proverb has done?</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Now could I curse my Grand-mother, for she taught
'em me: Well, if sweet <i>Mephostopholis</i> will be so kind as but
to let us and the Table come together again, I'll promise never
to say Grace, or speak Proverb more, as long as I live.</p>

<p>[<i>They are let down to the Table.</i></p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Your Prayers are heard, now be careful; for if I
lose my Supper by thy Negligence I'll cut thy Throat.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Do, and eat me when you have done. I am damnably

Pot of wild Fowl.</p>

<p>[Harlequin <i>takes off the Lid of the Pasty, and a Stag's Head

<p><i>Har.</i> Here's the Nest but the Birds are flown: Here's Wine
though, and now I'll conjure for a Supper. I have a Sallad
within of my own Gathering in the Fields to Day.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Fetch it in; Bread, Wine, and a Salad may serve
for a Collation.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Harlequin <i>with a Tray of Sallad</i>.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Come, no Ceremony among Friends. <i>Bon. fro.</i></p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> <i>Sallad mal adjuste</i>; here's neither Fat nor Lean.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> O Mr. Doctor, neither Fat nor Lean in a Sallad.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Neither Oyl, nor Vinegar.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Oh! I'll fetch you that presently.</p>

<p>[Harlequin <i>fetches a Chamber-pot of Piss, and a Lamp

<p><i>Scar.</i> O thy Sallad is nothing but Thistles and Netles; and
thy Oyl stinks worse than <i>Arsefetito</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Har.</i> Bread and Wine be our Fare. Ha! the Bread's

<p><i>Har.</i> My Belly's as empty as a Beggar's Purse.</p>

<p>SCENE <i>a Wood</i>.</p>

<p>Mephostopholis <i>and Dr.</i> Faustus.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> How have I been delighted by thy Art; and in
Twelve Years have seen the utmost Limits of
the spacious World; feasted my self with all Varieties; pleasur'd
my Fancy with my Magick Art, and liv'd sole Lord
o'er every Thing I wish'd for.</p>

<p><i>Meph.</i> Ay, <i>Faustus</i>, is it not a splendid Life?</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> It is my Spirit; but prithee now retire, while I re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>pose
my self within this Shade, and when I wake attend on
me again.</p>

<p><i>Meph.</i> <i>Faust</i>, I will.      [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> What art thou, <i>Faustus</i>, but a Man condemn'd.
Thy Lease of Years expire apace; and, <i>Faustus</i>, then thou
must be <i>Lucifers</i>: Here rest my Soul, and in my Sleep my
future State be buried.</p>

<p><i>Good and bad Angel descends.</i></p>

<p><i>Good An.</i> <i>Faustus</i>, sweet <i>Faustus</i>, yet remember Heav'n.
Oh! think upon the everlasting Pain thou must endure,
For all thy short Space of Pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Bad An.</i> Illusions, Fancies, <i>Faustus</i>; think of Earth.
The Kings thou shalt command: The Pleasures Rule.
Be, <i>Faustus</i>, not a whining, pious Fool.      [<i>Ascend.</i></p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Horse-courser.</p>

<p><i>Hors.</i> Oh! what a couz'ning Doctor was this: I riding
my Horse into the Water, thinking some hidden Mystery
had been in 'em, found my self on a Bundle of Straw, and
was drag'd by Something in the Water, like a Bailiff through
a Horse-pond. Ha! he's a Sleep: So ho, Mr. Doctor, so ho.
Why Doctor, you couz'ning, wheedling, hypocritical, cheating,
chousing, Son of a Whore; awake, rise, and give me
my Mony again, for your Horse is turn'd into a Bottle of
Hay. Why Sirrah, Doctor; 'sfoot I think he's dead. Way
Doctor Scab; you mangy Dog.      [<i>pulls him by the Leg.</i>
'Zounds I'm undone, I have pull'd his Leg off.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> O help! the Villain has undone me; Murder.</p>

<p><i>Hors.</i> Murder, or not Murder, now he has but one Leg
I'll out-run him.      [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> Stop, stop him; ha, ha, ha, <i>Faustus</i> has his Leg
again, and the Horse-courser a Bundle of Hay for his Forty
Dollars. Come, <i>Mephostopholis</i>, let's now attend the Emperor.      [<i>Exit</i> Faust. <i>and</i> Meph.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Horse-courser, <i>and</i> Carter, <i>with Pots of Ale</i>.</p>

<p><i>Cart.</i> Here's to thee; and now I'll tell thee what I came
hither for: You have heard of a Conjurer they call Doctor
<i>Faustus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Hors.</i> Heard of him, a Plague take him, I have Cause to
know him; has he play'd any Pranks with you?</p>

<p><i>Cart.</i> I'll tell thee, as I was going to the Market a while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
ago, with a Load of Hay, he met me, and askt me, What
he should give me for as much Hay as his Horse would Eat:
Now, Sir, I thinking that a little would serve his Turn, bad
him take as much as he would for Three Farthings.</p>

<p><i>Hors.</i> So.</p>

<p><i>Cart.</i> So he presently gave me Mony, and fell to Eating:
And as I'm a cursen Man, he never left Yeating and Yeating,
'till he had eaten up my whole Load of Hay.</p>

<p><i>Hors.</i> Now you shall hear how he serv'd me: I went to
him Yesterday to buy a Horse of him, which I did; and he
bad me be sure not to ride him into the Water.</p>

<p><i>Cart.</i> Good.</p>

<p><i>Hors.</i> Ad's Wounds 'twas Bad, as you shall hear: For I
thinking the Horse had some rare Quality, that he would not
have me know, what do me I but rides him in the Water;
and when I came just in the midst of the River, I found my
self a Straddle on a Bottle of Hay.</p>

<p><i>Cart.</i> O rare Doctor!</p>

<p><i>Hors.</i> But you shall hear how I serv'd him bravely for
it; for finding him a Sleep just now in a By-Field, I whoop'd
and hollow'd in his Ears, but could not wake him; so I took
hold of his Leg, and never left pulling till I had pull'd it
quite off.</p>

<p><i>Cart.</i> And has the Doctor but one Leg then? That's Rare.
But come, this is his House, let's in and see for our Mony;
look you, we'll pay as we come back.</p>

<p><i>Hors.</i> Done, done; and when we have got our Mony
let's laugh at his one Leg: Ha, ha, ha.      [<i>Exeunt Laughing.</i></p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Hostess.</p>

<p><i>Host.</i> What have the Rogues left my Pots, and run away,
without paying their Reck'ning? I'll after 'em, cheating
Villains, Rogues, Cut-purses; rob a poor Woman, cheat the
Spittle, and rob the King of his Excise; a parcel of Rustick,
Clownish, Pedantical, High-shoo'd, Plow-jobbing, Cart-driving,
Pinch-back'd, Paralytick, Fumbling, Grumbling, Bellowing,
Yellowing, Peas-picking, Stinking, Mangy, Runagate,
Ill-begotten, Ill-contriv'd, Wry-mouth'd, Spatrifying,

Dogs.      [<i>Exit</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Faustus.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> My Time draws near, and 20 Years are past: I
have but Four poor Twelve Months for my Life, and then I
am damn'd for ever.</p>

<p><i>Enter an</i> Old Man.</p>

<p><i>Old M.</i> O gentle <i>Faustus</i>, leave this damn'd Art; this Magick,
that will charm thy Soul to Hell, and quite bereave
thee of Salvation: Though thou hast now offended like a
Man, do not, oh! do not persist in't like a Devil. It may
be this my Exhortation seems harsh, and all unpleasant; let
it not, for, gentle Son, I speak in tender Love and Pity of
thy future Misery; and so have hope that this my kind Rebuke,
checking thy Body, may preserve thy Soul.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> Where art thou, <i>Faustus</i>? Wretch, what hast thou
done? O Friend, I feel thy Words to comfort my distressed
Soul; retire, and let me ponder on my Sins.</p>

<p><i>Old M.</i> <i>Faustus</i>, I leave thee, but with grief of Heart,
Fearing thy Enemy will near depart.      [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Mephostopholis.</p>

<p><i>Meph.</i> Thou Traytor, I arrest thee for Disobedience to
thy Sovereign Lord; revolt, or I'll in piece-meal tear thy
Flesh.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> I do repent I e'er offended him; torment, sweet
Friend, that old Man that durst disswade me from thy <i>Lucifer</i>.</p>

<p><i>Meph.</i> His Faith is great, I cannot touch his Soul; but
what I can afflict his Body with I will.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Horse-courser <i>and</i> Carter.</p>

<p><i>Hors.</i> We are come to drink a Health to your wooden
Leg.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> My wooden Leg; what dost thou mean, Friend?</p>

<p><i>Hors.</i> Ha, ha! he has forgot his Leg.</p>

<p><i>Cart.</i> Psha, 'tis not a Leg he stands upon. Pray, let me
ask you one Question; Are both your Legs Bed-fellows?</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> Why dost thou ask?</p>

<p><i>Cart.</i> Because I believe you have a good Companion of
one.</p>

<p><i>Hors.</i> Why, don't you remember I pull'd off one o' your
Legs when you were a Sleep?</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> But I have it again now I am awake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cart.</i> Ad's Wounds, had the Doctor three Legs!&mdash;--You,
Sir, don't you remember you gave a Peny for as much
Hay as your Horse would eat, and then eat up my whole
Load.</p>

<p><i>Hors.</i> Look you, Mr. Doctor, you must not carry it off
so; I come to have the Mony again I gave for the Ho-o-o-</p>

<p>[Faustus <i>waves his Wand</i>.</p>

<p><i>Cart.</i> And I come to be paid far my Load of Ha-a-a.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Hostess.</p>

<p><i>Host.</i> O Mr. Doctor! do you harbour Rogues that bilk
poor Folks, and wont pay their Reck'nings? Who must pay
me for my A-a-a-a      [<i>Waves again.</i></p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Scaramouche.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Mr. Doctor, I can't be quiet for your Devil
Mr. <i>Me-o-o&mdash;</i>      [<i>Waves again.</i></p>

<p>[<i>Exeunt</i> Faustus <i>and</i> Mephostopholis. <i>They all stare at
one another, and so go off, crying O, o, o, o- to the
Emperor's Pallace.</i></p>

<p><i>Emp.</i> Wonder of Men, thrice Learned <i>Faustus</i>, Renowned
Magician, welcome to our Court; and as thou late didst
promise us, I would behold the Famous <i>Alexander</i> fighting
with his great Rival <i>Darius</i>, in their true Shapes, and State
Majestical.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> Your Majesty shall see 'em presently.</p>

<p><i>Ben.</i> If thou bring'st <i>Alexander</i>, or <i>Darius</i> here, I'll be
content to be <i>Actæon</i>, and turn my self to a Stag.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> And I'll play <i>Diana</i>, and send you the Horns presently.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Darius <i>and</i> Alexander; <i>they Fight</i>: Darius <i>falls</i>.
Alexander <i>takes his Crown, and puts it on his Head</i>.</p>

<p>[<i>Exit.</i> Darius <i>sinks</i>.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> Away, be gon; see, my Gracious Lord, what Beast
is that that thrusts his Head out of yon' Window.</p>

<p><i>Emp.</i> O wondrous Sight! see two Horns on young <i>Benoolio</i>'s
Head; call him, Lords.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> What, ho! <i>Benoolio</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ben.</i> A Plague upon you, let me Sleep.</p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Look up, <i>Benoolio</i>, 'tis the Emperor calls.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ben.</i> The Emperor; O my Head.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> And thy Horns hold, 'tis no matter for thy Head.</p>

<p><i>Ben.</i> Doctor, this is your Villany.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> O say not so, Sir; the Doctor has no Skill, if he
bring <i>Alexander</i> or <i>Darius</i> here you'll be <i>Actæon</i>, and turn to
a Stag: Therefore, if it please your Majesty, I'll bring a
Kennel of Hounds to hunt him. Ho! <i>Helmot</i>, <i>Argiron</i>,
<i>Asterot</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ben.</i> Hold, he'll raise a Kennel of Devils. Good, my Lord,
intreat.</p>

<p><i>Emp.</i> Prithee remove his Horns, he has done Penance
enough.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> Away; and remember hereafter you speak well of
Scholars.</p>

<p><i>Ben.</i> If Scholars be such Cuckolds to put Horns upon honest
Mens Heads, I'll ne'er trust Smooth-face and Small-band
more: But if I been't reveng'd, may I be turn'd to a Gaping
Oyster, and drink nothing but Salt-water.</p>

<p><i>Emp.</i> Come, <i>Faustus</i>, in recompence of this high Desert,
Thou shalt command the State of <i>Germany</i>, and live belov'd
of mighty <i>Carolus</i>.      [<i>Exeunt omnes.</i></p>

<p><i>Lord.</i> Nay, sweet <i>Benoolio</i>, let us sway thy Thoughts from
this Attempt against the Conjurer.</p>

<p>
<i>Ben.</i> My Head is lighter than it was by the Horns:<br />
And yet my Heart's more pond'rous than my Head,<br />
And pants, until I see the Conjurer dead.<br />

me first, that all the World may see my just Revenge; and

<p>SCENE <i>a Hall</i>.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Harlequin <i>in a Beggar's Habit</i>.</p>

<p><i>Harl.</i> I find this <i>Scaramouche</i> is a Villain; he has left the
Doctor, and is come to be Steward to a rich Widdow,
whose Husband dyed Yesterday, and here he is coming to
give the Poor their Doles, of which I'll ha' my Share.</p>

<p>Scaramouche, <i>and poor People, with a Basket of
Bread and Money</i>.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Come hither, poor Devils; stand in Order, and be
Damn'd. I came to distribute what your deceased good
Master hath bequeath'd.      [<i>They all stare at</i> Scar.</p>

<p><i>Harl.</i> God bless you, Mr. Steward.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Let me tell you, Gentlemen, he was as good a Man
as ever piss'd, or cry'd Stand on the High-way.</p>

<p>[Scaramouche <i>takes out a Leaf and a Shilling, holds
it out, and</i> Harlequin <i>takes it</i>.</p>

<p>He spent a good Estate, 'tis true; but he was no Body's
Foe but his own. I never left him while he was worth a
Groat. [<i>Again.</i>] He would now and then Curse in his Passion,
and give a Soul to the Devil, or so; yet, what of that?
He always paid his Club, and no Man can say he owes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
this. [<i>Again.</i>] He had a Colt's Tooth, and over-laid one of
his Maids; yet, what of that? All Flesh is frail. [<i>Again.</i>]
'Tis thought that her Body workt him off on his Legs; why,
what of that? his Legs were his own, and his Arse never
hung in your Light. [<i>Again.</i>] Sometimes, you'll say, he wou'd
rap out an Oath; what then, Words are but Wind, and he
meant no more harm than a sucking Pig does by squeaking.
[<i>Again.</i>] Now let's consider his good Deeds; he brew'd
a Firkin of strong Drink for the poor every Year, and kill'd
an old Ram every <i>Easter</i>: The Meat that was stale, and his
Drink that was sowre, was always yours. [<i>Again.</i>] He allow'd
you in Harvest to Glean after his Rake. [<i>Again.</i>] And
now, at his Death, has given you all this.      [<i>Again.</i></p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> So, setting the Hare's Head against the Goose Giblets,
he was a good Hospitable Man; and much good may do you
with what you had.</p>

<p><i>Poor.</i> I have had nothing.</p>

<p><i>2 Poor.</i> Nor I.</p>

<p><i>3 Po.</i> Nor I.</p>

<p><i>4 Po.</i> Nor. I.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Nothing.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Nothing, nothing.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Nothing, nothing; you lying Rogues, then there's
something for you.      [<i>Beats 'em all off.</i></p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Harlequin <i>in a Cloak, laughing</i>.</p>

<p><i>Har.</i> So now I am Victual'd, I may hold out Siege against
Hunger.      [<i>A Noise within; this way, this way.</i></p>

<p>Ha! they are hunting after me, and will kill me. Let me see,
I will take this Gibbet for my Preserver, and with this long
Cloak make as if I were hang'd. Now when they find a
Man hang'd, not knowing me in this Disguise, they'll look
no farther after me, but think the Thief's hang'd.&mdash;&mdash;I
hear 'em coming.      [<i>Throws himself off the Ladder.</i></p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Scaramouche.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Ha! what's here, a Man hang'd? But what Paper
is this in his Hand?</p>

<p>[<i>Whil'st</i> Scaramouche <i>reads</i>, Harlequin <i>puts
the Rope over him</i>.</p>

<p>I have cheated the Poor of their Mony, and took the Bread
out of their Mouths, for which I was much troubled in Conscience,
fell into Dispair, and, as you see, hang'd my self.</p>

<p>[<i>Pulls him up, and runs out</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Poor.</i> O Neighbours, here hangs the Rogue.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Help me down?</p>

<p><i>Poor.</i> No, you are very well as you are.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Don't you know me?</p>

<p><i>Poor.</i> Ay, for a Rogue; e'en finish your Work, and save
the Hang-man a Labour. Yet, now I think on't, self-murder
is a crying Sin, and may damn his Soul. Come, Neighbours,
we'll take him down, and have him hang'd according
to Law.      [<i>When he's down he trips up their Heels, and
runs out, they after him.</i></p>

<p><i>All.</i> Stop Thief, stop Thief.</p>

<p><i>Thunder and Lightning</i>; Lucifer, Beelzebub,
<i>and</i> Mephostopholis.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Thus from the infernal <i>Dis</i> do we ascend, bringing
with us the Deed; the Time is come which makes it forfeit.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Faustus, <i>an old Man, and a Scholar</i>.</p>

<p><i>Old M.</i> Yet, <i>Faustus</i>, call on Heav'n.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> Oh! 'tis too late; behold, they lock my Hands.</p>

<p><i>Old M.</i> Who, <i>Faustus</i>?</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> <i>Lucifer</i> and <i>Mephostopholis</i>; I gave 'em my Soul for
Four and twenty Years.</p>

<p><i>Old M.</i> Heav'n forbid.</p>

<p><i>Fau.</i> Ay, Heav'n forbad it indeed, but <i>Faustus</i> has done it;
for the vain Pleasure of Four and twenty Years, <i>Faustus</i> has
lost eternal Joy and Felicity: I writ 'em a Bill with my own
Blood, the Date is expired; this is the Time, and they are
come to fetch me.</p>

<p><i>Old M.</i> Why would not <i>Faustus</i> tell me of that before?</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> I oft intended it, but the Devil threat'ned to tear
me in Pieces. O Friend, retire, and save your self.</p>

<p><i>Old M.</i> I'll into the next Room, and there pray for thee.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> Ay, pray for me; and what Noise soever you hear
stir not, for nothing can rescue me.</p>

<p><i>Old M.</i> Pray thou, and I'll pray. Adieu.</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> If I live till Morning I'll visit you; if not, <i>Faustus</i>
is gon to Hell.      [<i>Exeunt old Man and Scholar.</i></p>

<p><i>Meph.</i> Ay, <i>Faustus</i>, now thou hast no hopes on Heav'n.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>

<br />

And now, poor Soul, must thy good Angel leave:<br />

Into that Vast perpetual torturing House.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Faust.</i> O I have seen enough to torture me.</p>

<p>
<i>Bad An.</i> Nay thou must feel 'em, 'taste the Smart of all.<br />
He that loves Pleasure must for Pleasure fall:<br />
And so I leave thee, <i>Faustus</i>, till anon.<br />

<p>Or let this Hour be but a Year, a Month, a Week, a natural

heavy Wrath of Heav'n. Gape Earth; Oh no, it will not
harbour me.      [<i>The Clock strikes.</i>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
